### What I have learned 

What a repository is, how to create one, and how to add files to a repository. E.g. creating a profile README.

To make comments at checkpoints to remind myself of what I did last time. 

The difference between branches and forks. How to isolate different works with branches and add them to your repository (main branch). Forks allow you to play with other people's projects without changing the original. 

Issues aren't just problems - they could be enhancements you want added to your project. 

### Questions I have

In group work with GitHub, you are allowed to work together with other people and merge changes made at the end. How does this work? Won't changes overlap and/or override eachother?

In GitHub, you can revert back to older versions of your work. How does this work? Is it saved by session or can you choose "savepoints"? If you decide that you didn't want to revert it, could you change it back?
